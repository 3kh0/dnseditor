# Hack Club DNS ~~Editor~~ Viewer

Simple Nuxt app to view Hack Club's DNS records, pulling data from the [`hackclub/dns`](https://github.com/hackclub/dns) repo.

This was intended to be able to suggest changes to the records in the form of pull requests performed by the server, but that has been scraped to due organizational headaches.

## Live Demo

You can view it here: [dnsedit.3kh0.net](https://dnsedit.3kh0.net/)
